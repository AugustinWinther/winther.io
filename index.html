				<h2>Hi there!</h2>
				<p> My name is Augustin Winther. I'm a 22-year-old computer nerd from Western Norway studying physics at the University of Bergen. </p>

				<p> I started on my physics bachelor in August of 2022. I've had a passion for physics for as 
					long as I can remember. Everything regarding our understanding of nature, from the tiniest quarks to the largest galaxies, are subjects
					I will never grow tired of. If you want to know more about me, continue scrolling!

				<!-- SKILLS -->
				<div class="infobox infobox-left has-btn">
					<h2>SKILLS</h2>
					
					<h3>Language</h3>
					<p> I communicate in both
						<span class="orange">English</span> and
						<span class="orange">Norwegian</span>
						fluently.
					</p>
					<hr>

					<h3>Programming</h3>
					<p> The languages I most often use are: 
						<span class="orange">Python</span>,
						<span class="orange">C</span>, and
						<span class="orange">Bash</span>.
					</p>
					<button id="prog-btn" class="orange">Read more</button>
					<div id="prog" class="hidden">
						<p> This is probably what I have the greatest passion for besides physics. I have been programming on and off since I was 13,
                            and as soon as I am "in the zone", I can code for hours without noticing that the time is flying by. </p>
                        <p> I'm an easy learner, so learning new languages and frameworks goes by pretty smoothly.</p>
					</div>
					<hr>

					<h3>Physics and Math</h3>
					<p> I really enjoy working with the two subjects and I have a good comprehension of them both.
					</p>
					<button id="sci-btn" class="orange">Read more</button>
					<div id="sci" class="hidden">
						<p> Science, mainly physics, has probably been my strongest passion for as long as I can remember. I have a huge interest in the subject, 
							and I want to learn and understand as much as possible about the universe.</p>
					</div>
					<hr>

					<h3>Network and computer security</h3>
					<p> Multiple years of experience with:
						<span class="orange">LAN</span>,
						<span class="orange">firewall</span>,
						<span class="orange">backup</span>,
						<span class="orange">server</span>, and
						<span class="orange">VPN</span>.
					</p>
					<button id="net-btn" class="orange">Read more</button>
					<div id="net" class="hidden">
						<p> Computer security and redundancy are essential on my home network and my devices.
                            2-Factor authentication wherever it's possible, on-site and off-site backup, self-hosting of cloud and password manager, VPN, etc. </p>
						<p> Hundreds of hours of seting up and maintaing servers and networks have given me a lot of knowledge in this field.
                            These hours have resulted in respectable knowledge with: 
							<span class="orange">Linux</span>,
							<span class="orange">Docker</span>,
							<span class="orange">pfSense</span>, and
							<span class="orange">VPN</span>.
						</p>

					<h3>Web Design</h3>
					<p>	I've got experience with:
						<span class="orange">HTML</span>,
						<span class="orange">CSS</span>,
						<span class="orange">JS</span>, and some
						<span class="orange">PHP</span> and
						<span class="orange">SQL</span>.
					</p>
					<button id="web-btn" class="orange">Read more</button>
					<div id="web" class="hidden">
						<p> Unless time is of the essence, I prefer to code websites myself. The more control, the better. </p>
						<p> I coded this website from scratch, except some PHP and JS for form validation.</p>
					</div>
					<hr>

					<h3>Graphical Design</h3>
					<p> I have a decent amount of experience in image manipulation and some in vector design.</p>
					<button id="gfx-btn" class="orange">Read more</button>
					<div id="gfx" class="hidden">
						<p> Sometimes I end up making graphics for different projects, which I think is great fun!</p>
						<p> The programs I use are mainly <span class="orange">Inkscape</span> and <span class="orange">GIMP</span>, so i know
                            my way around them</p>

					<h3>Creative</h3>
					<p> Creating new things, or solving problems, is something that motivates me every day.

					</p>
					<hr>

					<h3>Caring</h3>
					<p> I love making people smile and laugh. I get along well with new people and do what I can to
